# ABOUT PAGE

## 1. What the Site Is

**Core explanation**

* What does this website do?
  > Aggregates touring figures from several k-pop artists, allowing comprehensive analysis on venue sise and popularity, most toured in regions and etc.

**Scope**

* Which artists are currently supported?
  > Currently, artists included stem from what is available on Touting Data's official website, from where most data comes from. Artist missing on the list most likely stem from the fact their company/promoter never reported their tour figures to Touring Data and no extensive and significative values are available.
  * Are soloists included?
    > Yes, soloists are included, as long as they have toured in the west too and had their tour reported officially somewhere.
  * Are sub-units included?
    > Currently, the only available sub-unit touring data available is TWICE's Japanese sub-unit, MISAMO.
  * Are disbanded or inactive artists included?
     > If the tour is reported, than yes.
  * Will more artists be added in the future?
    > Yes. Some new artists haven't had their first significant tour debut yet, but we plan to keep an eye on them too.
* How often does the site update?
  > Updates may be slow, as reports themselves may take some months to be made public.

## 2. What Data You Show

**Types of data**

* What kinds of data does the site aggregate?
> Data is aggragated by artist, tour, venue and company, varying availability, attendance, and box score. From this, other significant data may be calculated, as average box per show, ticket pricing, venue concert capacity, and etc.
* Does this site include festival or award shows appearances?
> We have access to some festival and award shows reports, but they are very few. For that, there's no public report available as of currently.
* Are fanmeetings included or excluded?
> Fanmeeting are generally not reported, we can retrieve some South Korean data from KOPIS if needed, but not for other countries. For that, there's no public report available as of currently.
* Does the site track cancelled or postponed shows?
> Yes, postponed and cancelled shows are reported.
* Does attendance mean tickets sold or people present?
> Attendance is the amount of tickets that where sold. We don't have access to the exact figures of people that were physically there in during the show.
* How do you calculate average ticket price?
> Box score divided by attendance.
* Does box score include merch revenue?
> No. The box score counts solely as ticket sales, from member ship pre sale, to general sales and vip tickets.
* Are show net capacities venue-reported or estimated?
> Reported for both Touring Data and Pollstar. KOPIS doesn't make public how many tickets were opened for sale, only how many were purchased.

**Granularity**

* Can I export or download data?
> There is currently interest in developing a way to download data both in a pdf and as csv and/or xlxs.

## 3. Data Sources & Accuracy

**Where the data comes from**

* What are your primary data sources?
> Data comes from 3 sources. Touring Data's official website and Patreon subscription. Public Pollstar reports. And KOPIS. There might be some ancient data from Billboard Box Score, but not a recurrent source anymore, given the halt of its availability.
* Are sources official, third-party, or fan-curated?
> The sources are official. Touring Data and Pollstar data comes from artists company or tour promoters themselves, *voluntarily*. KOPIS is a South Korean transparency portal for research purposes.
* Do you scrape data automatically or enter it manually?
> Manually. Due to this, data maybe delayed.
* Why do some tours show partial data instead of full legs?
> 
* Why do some venues show attendance but no box score?
> KOPIS reported shows may lack box score. This happens because KOPIS aggregates revenue by region, while ticket sales are aggregated by venue. If two artist's tour on the same day in the same distric of Seoul, South Korea, but in different venues, we'll only have clear access to their ticket sales, since their box score will be combined.
* Why is a tour listed even if only one date is reported?
> We're most likely waiting for future reports. In some cases, for older groups, it is possible that data was saved for comparisons.
* Do you prioritize one source over another?
> Yes. Pollstar is the most reliable source. Next comes Touring Data, and last KOPIS.
* Why is korean data sometimes higher than western reports?
> KOPIS reports, from South Korean government, may appear higher than Touring Data and Pollstar reports, that are voluntarily reported by companies and event promoters. It is uncertain why it happens, but most likely stems from staff reasons.
* Does currency conversion affect box score comparisons?
> Yes. Touring Data is the only source that reports everything in USD. Pollstar and KOPIS report their box score figures on the currency of the country in which the show happened. We convert to USD, using the USD price as of the last day of the show, and not the day of the report.
* How do you handle inflation across different years?
> We don't. It is expected that the user is aware of inflation and how much it impacts ticket prices and box revenues.

**Accuracy & updates**

* How often is data refreshed?
> KOPIS reports are automatic. As soon as the concert in South Korea ended data is available. Any delays maybe caused by the manual process of data retrieve. Touring Data and Pollstar rely on voluntary reports from companies and event promoters. Besides delays, it is also expected that not all venues will be reported.
* Why might numbers differ from other websites?
> Touring data figures vary depending on where you access it. Their Patreon early access, website and official Twitter/X account may share slightly different data, for unknown reasons. KOPIS also shows a slight difference on South Korean reports as to Touring Datas (companies and promoters), and often figure higher attendance and box score rates of what is reported by Touring Data and Pollstar.

**Disclaimers**

* Are numbers estimates or exact figures?
* > Exact figures. There are unofficial and estimated reports for a bunch of shows in out database, but they might be under or over reported. To avoid even more incongruence between websites and reports aside from what already has been noted, we don't retrieve those.

## 4. Charts, Rankings & Metrics

**Fairness & bias**

* Are newer groups disadvantaged?
> Quite the opposite. Newer groups are in advantage, since reports have been more and more common for the newer generation.
* Are older groups disadvantaged?
> They are. Older tours and reports will be missing due to unavailable data on Touring Data and KOPIS.

## 5. Legal & Copyright

**Ownership**

* Who owns the data displayed?
> No, this data is retrieved mainly from public sources and aggregated in a more k-pop user friendly environment.

## 6. Fan Etiquette & Community Guidelines

**Usage expectations**

* Can I use this data for fan projects?
> Data maybe used by fandom as a way to track and enhance development of their favorite artist as they please.
* Can I use it in videos, posts, or articles?
> Yes, as long as it does respectfully, without inciting targeted behavior and hate towards the artists.
* Do I need to credit the site?
> No. However, sharing is caring, and others maybe interested in what other data is available. Gatekeeping the website would be against its main purpose.
* Can I repost screenshots?
> Yes, as long as it does respectfully, without inciting targeted behavior and hate towards the artists.

**Behavior**

* Does the site discourage fanwars?
> This site doesn't condone fanwars and discourage the usage of screeshots to engage in such.
* How should users interpret comparisons?
> Comparisons should be interpreted as a way to comprehend market. Artist's will have different figures accordingly to their popularity in certain regions, and no region is better than other. Newer groups will also show smaller figures, and comparisons with older artists should serve the purpose of comparing growth and direction solely.

---

## 11. About the Creator(s)

* Why did you create it?
> I have a huge hyperfocus on spreadsheets and k-pop, so often times they converge into one big thing. Touring reports occurred to be one of them. As my spreadsheet grew bigger, it started to become harder and harder to see data and compare tours. Morover, not so fluent in excel friends constantly requested assistance when navigating my spreadsheets, which urged me to create something more user friendly.
* Are you a fan of the artists?
> Some of them, yes. Others, not so much. Regardless of my most liked artists, I remain unbiased when collecting and showing data. 
* Is this a solo project or a team?
> Coding wise, solo. Data wise, I have some friends that help me retrieving everything needed to keep things updated.

---

## 12. Common Confusions (Very K-pop Specific)

* Why does Artist A have fewer stats than Artist B?
> Since Touring Data and Pollstar reports rely on volunteer reports from either an artist's company or their tour promoter, the main reason is the artists' management.

> For further notice, a tour may have different promoters for different legs and/or countries. Asian countries are less likely to report to Touring Data and therefore, less popular artist's in the west may have less data available. As of western non-us countries, the same is applicable, but less common. A third possibility is that the sales rate was unsatisfactory and, therefore, the promoter or the company retained the report so to benefit the artist, venue or promoter's reputation.
