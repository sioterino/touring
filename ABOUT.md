**Scope**

* Which artists are currently supported?
  > Currently, artists included stem from what is available on Touting Data's official website, from where most data comes from. Artist missing on the list most likely stem from the fact their company/promoter never reported their tour figures to Touring Data and no extensive and significative values are available.
  * Are soloists included?
    > Yes, soloists are included, as long as they have toured in the west too and had their tour reported officially somewhere.
  * Are sub-units included?
    > Currently, the only available sub-unit touring data available is TWICE's Japanese sub-unit, MISAMO.
  * Are disbanded or inactive artists included?
     > If the tour is reported, than yes.
  * Will more artists be added in the future?
    > Yes. Some new artists haven't had their first significant tour debut yet, but we plan to keep an eye on them too.
* How often does the site update?
  > Updates may be slow, as reports themselves may take some months to be made public.
